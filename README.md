## Usage:

cat infile | ./Rainbow_MD5 > outfile

cat infile | ./Rainbow_SHA1(256,384,512) > outfile

## Scripts Explanation:
### Rainbow_MD5.sh
Read a text file line-by-line and output the MD5 hash digest of each line (using pipe | ). The script can be use to calculate the MD5 precomputed hashlist of a wordlist.

### Rainbow_SHA1.sh
Read a text file line-by-line and output the MD5 hash digest of each line (using pipe | ). The script can be use to calculate the SHA1 precomputed hashlist of a wordlist.

### Rainbow_SHA256.sh
Read a text file line-by-line and output the MD5 hash digest of each line (using pipe | ). The script can be use to calculate the SHA256 precomputed hashlist of a wordlist.

### Rainbow_SHA384.sh
Read a text file line-by-line and output the MD5 hash digest of each line (using pipe | ). The script can be use to calculate the SHA384 precomputed hashlist of a wordlist.

### Rainbow_SHA512.sh
Read a text file line-by-line and output the MD5 hash digest of each line (using pipe | ). The script can be use to calculate the SHA512 precomputed hashlist of a wordlist.
